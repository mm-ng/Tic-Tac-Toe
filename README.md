# Tic-Tac-Toe

A console-based implementation of the old-school Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

## Game Play
The game supports two players and each player will assume an "X" or an "O".
Players will take turns until a player wins, or the 3x3 board fills up and the players draw.

To start playing the game:

```
python tictactoe.py
```
